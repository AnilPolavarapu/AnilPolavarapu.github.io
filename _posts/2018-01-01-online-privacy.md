title: Usable security tips for online privacy
---

This post is targeting non-developers, so please go easy on the examples I take.

### Who should I be leary about?

Citing only the biggest players.

Google

Facebook

Amazon

### How am I tracked online?

You can use an extension like Firefox Lightbeam to understand the how different websites are interconnected.

### What can they do with my data?

Targeted propaganda (ads are one form of propaganda)

Create an echo-chamber to reinforce false/bad behavior

### What can I do?

#### Search engine

Use DuckDuckGo instead of Google search.

#### Sharing controls

Platforms have bad defaults but fortunately they let you choose the sharing level on various things (like posts, likes & media). 

#### Use Mozilla Firefox

Firefox is very snappy now and there is no reason not to be on it.

#### Use privacy extensions

1. Privacy Badger

2. Ublock origin

3. NoScript

4. AdBlock Plus

5. Firefox containers

You can additionally block domains in your hosts file.

#### Messages

Install Signal on your phones or use iMessage. I can no longer recommend Whatsapp after its founder has publicly urged people to stop using Facebook (Facebook owns Whatsapp).

### Internet providers

ISP's (Internet service providers) like Comcast, Verizon & Centurylink have become a necessary evil these days. As of Apr 2017, I am no longer paying the broadband ISPs. I hotspot from my T-Mobile plan and that gives me reliable & fast speed to watch videos and support frequent work from home days. The money you pay for the extra speed is mostly going for lobbying (like the one against Net Neutrality).

### Products I strongly recommend NOT buying

#### Anything with Amazon Alexa

The conveniences are not worth the lack of privacy. There is no public audit of what data is collected and how is it used.

#### Android powered phones

Unless you are using a hardened version which doesn't have Google play services. 

If you do own one and cannot switch, never ROOT the phone.

#### Google chrome

There is no public audit of what data is shipped back to Google.
